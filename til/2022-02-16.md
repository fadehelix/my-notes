## React batch update
React 16 and 17 does not batch state updated which are call by promise
React 18 batches **all** state updates


## React memo and useMemo
`memo()` is used to shallow compare **props** (it only compares primitives)
`useMemo`  / `useCallback` is usefull for caching expensive calculations
